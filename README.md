User Dynamics and Thematic Exploration in r/Depression during COVID-19

Abstract

Background:
The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened concerns about a growing mental health crisis, including an increase in suicidal thoughts. Identifying early signs of suicidal ideation is complex, often associated with symptoms of depression, making timely intervention challenging. Online communities have emerged as crucial support systems, providing communication channels for individuals dealing with mental health challenges. These virtual communities represent a shift in how we approach mental health support, especially for those dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts.

Objective:
This repository explores user behavior within two Reddit communities, r/SuicideWatch and r/Depression, from 2019 to 2022. The main objective is to gain insights into user-generated content, transition patterns, and themes among users active in both subreddits. We focus on the transition from discussions primarily about depression to explicit discussions of suicidal ideation. Our goal is to use these insights to improve psychiatric evaluation and suicide prevention interventions.
